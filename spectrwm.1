.Sh NAME
.Nm spectrwm
.Nd window manager for X11
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm spectrwm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a minimalistic window manager that tries to stay out of the way so that
valuable screen real estate can be used for much more important stuff.
It has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a language to do any
configuration.
It was written by hackers for hackers and it strives to be small, compact and
fast.
.Pp
When
.Nm
starts up, it reads settings from its configuration file,
.Pa spectrwm.conf .
See the
.Sx CONFIGURATION FILES
section below.
.Pp
The following notation is used throughout this page:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Cm M
Meta
.It Cm S
Shift
.It Aq Cm Name
Named key
.It Cm M1
Mouse button 1
.It Cm M3
Mouse button 3
.El
.Pp
.Nm
is very simple in its use.
Most of the actions are initiated via key or mouse bindings.
See the
.Sx BINDINGS
section below for defaults and customizations.
.Sh CONFIGURATION FILES
.Nm
first tries to open the user specific file,
.Pa ~/.spectrwm.conf .
If that file is unavailable,
it then tries to open the global configuration file
.Pa /etc/spectrwm.conf .
.Pp
The format of the file is \*(Ltkeyword\*(Gt = \*(Ltsetting\*(Gt.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl color_focus = red
.Pp
Enabling or disabling an option is done by using 1 or 0 respectively.
.Pp
The file supports the following keywords:
.Bl -tag -width 2m
.It Ic autorun
Launch an application in a specified workspace at start-of-day.
Defined in the format ws[<idx>]:application, e.g. ws[2]:xterm launches an
xterm in workspace 2.
.It Ic bar_action
External script that populates additional information in the status bar,
such as battery life.
.It Ic bar_at_bottom
Place the statusbar at the bottom of each region instead of the top.
.It Ic bar_border Ns Bq Ar x
Color of the status bar border in screen
.Ar x .
.It Ic bar_border_width
Set status bar border thickness in pixels.
Disable border by setting to 0.
.It Ic bar_color Ns Bq Ar x
Color of the status bar window in screen
.Ar x .
.It Ic bar_delay
Update frequency, in seconds, of external script that populates the status bar.
.It Ic bar_enabled
Enable or disable status bar.
.It Ic bar_font
Status bar font.
.It Ic bar_font_color Ns Bq Ar x
Color of the font in status bar in screen
.Ar x .
.It Ic bar_justify
Justify the status bar text. Possible values are
.Pa left ,
.Pa center ,
and
.Pa right .
.It Ic bind Ns Bq Ar x
Bind key combo to action
.Ar x .
See the
.Sx BINDINGS
section below.
.It Ic border_width
Set window border thickness in pixels.
Disable all borders by setting to 0.
.It Ic clock_enabled
Enable or disable displaying the clock in the status bar.
Disable by setting to 0
so a custom clock could be used in the
.Pa bar_action
script.
.It Ic color_focus
Border color of the currently focussed window.
.It Ic color_unfocus
Border color of unfocussed windows.
.It Ic dialog_ratio
Some applications have dialogue windows that are too small to be useful.
This ratio is the screen size to what they will be resized.
For example, 0.6 is 60% of the physical screen size.
.It Ic disable_border
Remove border when bar is disabled and there is only one window on the screen.
.It Ic focus_mode
Using a value of
.Pa follow_cursor
will make the window manager focus the window
under the mouse when switching workspaces and creating windows.
.It Ic keyboard_mapping
Clear all key bindings and load new key bindings from the specified file.
This allows you to load pre-defined key bindings for your keyboard layout.
See the
.Sx KEYBOARD MAPPING FILES
section below for a list of keyboard mapping files that have been provided
for several keyboard layouts.
.It Ic layout
Select layout to use at start-of-day.
Defined in the format
ws[idx]:master_grow:master_add:stack_inc:layout:always_raise:stack_mode, e.g.
ws[2]:-4:0:1:0:horizontal sets worskspace 2 to the horizontal stack mode and
shrinks the master area by 4 ticks and adds one window to the stack, while
maintaining default floating window behavior.
Possible stack_mode values are
.Pa vertical ,
.Pa horizontal
and
.Pa fullscreen .
.Pp
See
.Pa master_grow ,
.Pa master_shrink ,
.Pa master_add ,
.Pa master_del ,
.Pa stack_inc ,
.Pa stack_dec ,
and
.Pa always_raise
for more information.
Note that the stacking options are complicated and have side-effects.
One should familiarize oneself with these commands before experimenting with the
.Pa layout
option.
.Pp
This setting is not retained at restart.
.It Ic modkey
Change mod key.
Mod1 is generally the ALT key and Mod4 is the windows key on a PC.
.It Ic program Ns Bq Ar p
Define new action to spawn a program
.Ar p .
See the
.Sx PROGRAMS
section below.
.It Ic quirk Ns Bq Ar c:n
Add "quirk" for windows with class
.Ar c
and name
.Ar n .
See the
.Sx QUIRKS
section below.
.It Ic region
Allocates a custom region, removing any autodetected regions which occupy the same
space on the screen.
Defined in the format screen[<idx>]:WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y,
e.g.\& screen[1]:800x1200+0+0.
.Pp
To make a screen span multiple monitors, create a region big enough to cover
them all, e.g. screen[1]:2048x768+0+0 makes the screen span two monitors with
1024x768 resolution sitting one next to the other.
.It Ic stack_enabled
Enable or disable displaying the current stacking algorithm in the status bar.
.It Ic term_width
Set a preferred minimum width for the terminal.
If this value is greater than 0,
.Nm
will attempt to adjust the font sizes in the terminal to keep the terminal
width above this number as the window is resized.
Only
.Xr xterm 1
is currently supported.
The
.Xr xterm 1
binary must not be setuid or setgid, which it is by default on most systems.
Users may need to set program[term] (see the
.Sx PROGRAMS
section) to use an alternate copy of the
.Xr xterm 1
binary without the setgid bit set.
.It Ic title_class_enabled
Enable or disable displaying the window class in the status bar.
Enable by setting to 1.
.It Ic title_name_enabled
Enable or disable displaying the window title in the status bar.
Enable by setting to 1.
.It Ic urgent_enabled
Enable or disable the urgency hint.
Note that many terminal emulators require this to be enabled for it to
propagate.
In xterm, for example, one needs to add the following line
.Pa xterm.urgentOnBell: true
to
.Pa .Xdefaults .
.It Ic verbose_layout
Enable or disable displaying the current master and stack values in the status
bar.
Enable by setting to 1.
.It Ic window_name_enabled
Enable or disable displaying the window name in the status bar.
Enable by setting to 1.
.El
.Pp
Colors need to be specified per the
.Xr XQueryColor 3
specification and fonts need to be specified per the
.Xr XQueryFont 3
specification.
.Pp
To list the available fonts in your system see
.Xr fc-list 1
or
.Xr xlsfonts 1
manpages.
The
.Xr xfontsel 1
application can help you to show the X Logical Font Description ("XLFD") used
as setting in the keyword
.Pa bar_font .
.Sh PROGRAMS
.Nm
allows you to define custom actions to launch programs of your choice and then
bind them the same as with built-in actions.
See the
.Sx BINDINGS
section below.
.Pp
The default programs are described below:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "screenshot_wind" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm term
xterm
.It Cm screenshot_all
screenshot.sh full
.It Cm screenshot_wind
screenshot.sh window
.It Cm lock

.It Cm initscr
initscreen.sh
.It Cm menu
dmenu_run \-fn $bar_font \-nb $bar_color \-nf $bar_font_color \-sb $bar_border \-sf $bar_color
.El
.Pp
Custom programs in the configuration file are specified as follows:
.Pp
.Dl program[<name>] = <progpath> [<arg> [... <arg>]]
.Pp
.Aq name
is any identifier that does not conflict with a built-in action or keyword,
.Aq progpath
is the desired program, and
.Aq arg
is zero or more arguments to the program.
.Pp
The following variables represent settable values in
.Nm
(see the
.Sx CONFIGURATION FILES
section above),
and may be used in the
.Aq arg
fields and will be substituted for values at the time the program is spawned:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "$bar_font_color" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm $bar_border
.It Cm $bar_color
.It Cm $bar_font
.It Cm $bar_font_color
.It Cm $color_focus
.It Cm $color_unfocus
.El
.Pp
Example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
program[ff] = /usr/local/bin/firefox http://spectrwm.org/
bind[ff] = Mod+Shift+b # Now Mod+Shift+B launches firefox
.Ed
.Pp
To undo the previous:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind[] = Mod+Shift+b
program[ff] =
.Ed

.Pp
Custom bindings in the configuration file are specified as follows:
.Pp
.Dl bind[<action>] = <keys>
.Pp
.Aq action
is one of the actions listed above (or empty) and
.Aq keys
is in the form of zero or more modifier keys
(MOD, Mod1, Shift, etc.) and one or more normal keys
(b, space, etc.), separated by "+".
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
bind[reset] = Mod4+q # bind Windows-key + q to reset
bind[] = Mod1+q # unbind Alt + q
.Ed
.Pp
To use the currently defined
.Ic modkey ,
specify MOD as the modifier key.
.Pp
Multiple key combinations may be bound to the same action.
.Sh KEYBOARD MAPPING FILES
Keyboard mapping files for several keyboard layouts are listed
below.
These files can be used with the

.El
.Sh QUIRKS
.Nm
provides "quirks" which handle windows that must be treated specially
in a tiling window manager, such as some dialogs and fullscreen apps.
.Pp
The default quirks are described below:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "OpenOffice.org N.M:VCLSalFrame<TAB>XXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Firefox\-bin:firefox\-bin
TRANSSZ
.It Firefox:Dialog
FLOAT
.It Gimp:gimp
FLOAT + ANYWHERE
.It MPlayer:xv
FLOAT + FULLSCREEN + FOCUSPREV
.It OpenOffice.org 2.4:VCLSalFrame
FLOAT
.It OpenOffice.org 3.1:VCLSalFrame
FLOAT
.It pcb:pcb
FLOAT
.It xine:Xine Window
FLOAT + ANYWHERE
.It xine:xine Panel
FLOAT + ANYWHERE
.It xine:xine Video Fullscreen Window
FULLSCREEN + FLOAT
.It Xitk:Xitk Combo
FLOAT + ANYWHERE
.It Xitk:Xine Window
FLOAT + ANYWHERE
.It XTerm:xterm
XTERM_FONTADJ
.El
.Pp
The quirks themselves are described below:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XTERM_FONTADJ<TAB>XXX" -offset indent -compact
.It FLOAT
This window should not be tiled, but allowed to float freely.
.It TRANSSZ
Adjusts size on transient windows that are too small using dialog_ratio
(see
.Sx CONFIGURATION FILES ) .
.It ANYWHERE
Allow window to position itself, uncentered.
.It XTERM_FONTADJ
Adjust xterm fonts when resizing.
.It FULLSCREEN
Remove border to allow window to use full screen size.
.It FOCUSPREV
On exit force focus on previously focused application not previous application
in the stack.
.El
.Pp
Custom quirks in the configuration file are specified as follows:
.Pp
.Dl quirk[<class>:<name>] = <quirk> [ + <quirk> ... ]
.Pp
.Aq class
and
.Aq name
specify the window to which the quirk(s) apply, and
.Aq quirk
is one of the quirks from the list above.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
quirk[MPlayer:xv] = FLOAT + FULLSCREEN + FOCUSPREV
quirk[pcb:pcb] = NONE  # remove existing quirk
.Ed
.Pp
You can obtain
.Aq class
and
.Aq name
by running
.Xr xprop 1
and then clicking on the desired window.
In the following example the main window of Firefox was clicked:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ xprop | grep WM_CLASS
WM_CLASS(STRING) = "Navigator", "Firefox"
.Ed
.Pp
Note that grepping for WM_CLASS flips class and name.
In the example above the quirk entry would be:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
quirk[Firefox:Navigator] = FLOAT
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
also automatically assigns quirks to windows based on the value
of the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE property as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_TOOLBAR<TAB>XXX" -offset indent -compact
.It _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK
FLOAT + ANYWHERE
.It _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_TOOLBAR
FLOAT + ANYWHERE
.It _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_UTILITY
FLOAT + ANYWHERE
.It _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_SPLASH
FLOAT
.It _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG
FLOAT
.El
.Pp
In all other cases, no automatic quirks are assigned to the window.
Quirks specified in the configuration file override the automatic quirks.
.Sh EWMH
.Nm
partially implements the Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH) specification.
This enables controlling windows as well as
.Nm
itself from external scripts and programs.
This is achieved by
.Nm
responding to certain ClientMessage events.
From the terminal these events
can be conveniently sent using tools such as
.Xr wmctrl 1
and
.Xr xdotool 1 .
For the
actual format of these ClientMessage events, see the EWMH specification.
.Pp
The id of the currently focused window is stored in the _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW
property of the root window.
This can be used for example to retrieve the
title of the currently active window with
.Xr xprop 1
and
.Xr grep 1 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ WINDOWID=`xprop \-root _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW | grep \-o "0x.*"`
$ xprop \-id $WINDOWID WM_NAME | grep \-o "\\".*\\""
.Ed
.Pp
A window can be focused by sending a _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW client message
to the root window.
For example, using
.Xr wmctrl 1
to send the message
(assuming 0x4a0000b is the id of the window to be focused):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ wmctrl \-i \-a 0x4a0000b
.Ed
.Pp
Windows can be closed by sending a _NET_CLOSE_WINDOW client message
to the root window.
For example, using
.Xr wmctrl 1
to send the message
(assuming 0x4a0000b is the id of the window to be closed):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ wmctrl \-i \-c 0x4a0000b
.Ed
.Pp
Windows can be floated and un-floated by adding or removing the
_NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE atom from the _NET_WM_STATE property of the window.
This can be achieved by sending a _NET_WM_STATE client message to the
root window.
For example, the following toggles the floating state of
a window using
.Xr wmctrl 1
to send the message (assuming 0x4a0000b is the  id of the window floated
or un-floated):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ wmctrl \-i \-r 0x4a0000b \-b toggle,_NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE
.Ed
.Pp
Floating windows can also be resized and moved by sending a
_NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOW client message to the root window.
For example,
using
.Xr wmctrl 1
to send the message (assuming 0x4a0000b is the id of
the window to be resize/moved):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ wmctrl \-i \-r 0x4a0000b \-e 0,100,50,640,480
.Ed
.Pp
This moves the window to (100,50) and resizes it to 640x480.
.Pp
Any _NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOW events received for stacked windows are ignored.
.Sh SIGNALS
Sending
.Nm
a HUP signal will restart it.
